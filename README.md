Simple Go API wrapper for the UniCloud REST API.

[UniCloud](http://www.univa.com/products) is a product of [Univa](http://www.univa.com) which can
provision (not just) Grid Engine to bare matel or cloud instances (like Amazon EC2).

# Examples

Examples can be found in the examples subdirectory. The build directory
contains pre-build compilations of the examples for Linux (and ARM6 and ARM8), MacOS, 
and Windows. These examples can be helpful for controlling UniCloud (e.g. 
growing and shrinking your Univa Grid Engine cluster) from a remote host
which can have any architecture.
